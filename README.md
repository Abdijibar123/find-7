## Find Seven

##### Your Task 📚:

Create a function called `findSeven` that takes an array of numbers and return "Found!" if the digit 7 appears in the array. Otherwise, return "there is no 7 in the array".

##### Examples 😃:

```
findSeven([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) ➞ "Found!"
// 7 contains the number seven.

findSeven([8, 6, 33, 100]) ➞ "there is no 7 in the array"
// None of the items contain 7 within them.
"there is no 7 in the array"
//  None of the items contain 7 wi
findSeven([2, 55, 60, 97, 86]) ➞ thin them.
```

Good Luck 😀
